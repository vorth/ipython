      "The heptagon numbers we defined in [Part 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/vorth/ipython/blob/master/heptagons/HeptagonNumbers.ipynb) are obviously useful for defining lengths of lines in a figure like the one below, since all of those line lengths are related to the $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ ratios.  But will heptagon numbers suffice for the coordinates we must give to a graphics library, to draw line segments on the screen?  The answer turns out to be yes, though we'll need one little trick to make it work.\n",
