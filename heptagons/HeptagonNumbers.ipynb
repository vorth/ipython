    "\n",
    "OK, to be entirely accurate, at the very end of the computation, when it is necessary to provide floating point values to the graphics library for drawing, there are exactly four irrational numbers used.  Up until that time, every point being manipulated is represented by a six-tuple of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps that does not surprise you too much.  Consider these additional facts:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Every intersection point you can see in the figures can be represented in the same way, as a six-tuple of integers.\n",
    " * The seven-fold rotation used in the computation is encoded using only integers.\n",
    " * These facts would all remain true no matter many times the nested heptagons or the spiral were iterated inward (scaling down) or outward (scaling up).\n",
    " \n",
    "Now you should be surprised, unless you already know a fair bit of college-level or even graduate-level mathematics.  This article, and two successive articles, will explain how it all works, and provide Python code to let you reproduce the figures or just play.  The math you need to already know is *easy* -- a little middle school algebra and geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along they way, you'll get a few pointers into the relevant parts of college-level mathematics, in case you want to dig deeper.  I hope that, like me, you'll find some joy and beauty in the mathematics that was never really evident when you learned it in school."

These similar triangles generate a set of relationships between $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$.  This becomes clearer if we hide most of the diagonals:\n",

In all such cases we need not be bothered by the fact that a number consists of more than just numerals.  We care more about the fact that these numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided, and still produce more numbers of the same form.  Mathematicians use the term *field* for such a system of numbers.\n",

Deriving the formula for division of heptagon numbers is considerably more difficult, requiring some linear algebra.  Also, to perform division, we would require *rational* coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ in every heptagon number, since the integers are not closed under division.  Fortunately, we don't need to do any division for our purposes here, so we can be satisfied with the comfortable ease of doing integer arithmetic."
